          <h6 class="text-uppercase fw-bold" style="padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:0px; padding-left:20px;font-family: Georgia">Introduction</h6>
              <p style="padding-left:10px; font-family: Georgia"><b>In May of 1949</b>, The People’s Daily (renmin ribao人民日报) ran an article on the epidemic-level infant mortality rates in rural villages(1).  According to their local survey, a group of 20 women had collectively given birth to 44 children. 32 of those births were attended by old-style delivery methods (旧法接生 jiufa jiesheng), which resulted in early infant death. 18 of which were attributed to neonatal tetanus. However, the 12 infants delivered by new-style delivery methods (新发接生 xinfa jiesheng) all survived. <br><br> <b>The article</b> also included the case of Ms. Liang, a 42-year-old woman who had given birth twice and lost both children to neonatal tetanus (脐风 qifeng). Fearing for her third child, she had sought advice on how to prevent tetanus. Someone suggested "If you bite off one of the child&#x27;s toes, next time you&#x27;ll be able to save the child. " (你把小孩子的脚指头咬掉一个，下次孩子就保住)(2). Ms. Liang followed the advice, but without effect; she lost her third child as well. It was only when she enlisted the help of a doctor (医生 yisheng) that she received productive advice. Since the reported cause of her children’s deaths was tetanus, the newborns likely contracted it when their umbilical cord was cut. To ensure her next child was delivered safely, the doctor told Ms. Liang that she should call comrades from the hospital to deliver the baby (请医院的同志来接生). With the help of hospital staff, Ms. Liang safely delivered her fourth child. <br><br> <b>Although only a few</b> lines in a newspapers article, this story and the accompanying statistics are emblematic of an important transformation in China during the middle of the twentieth century. Three of Ms. Liang’s children suffered from tetanus – a dangerously common illness that could be contracted by both mother and infant during the course of birth. The different advice she received shows one “superstitious” (3)  and ineffective response to tetanus as opposed to the effective clinical help she could receive from the hospital. The survey on old- and new-style midwifery further asserted the life-saving differences in childbirth services. <br><br> <b>None of these issues</b> were new in the 1950s. Disease and birth complications are, of course, well documented in medical literature and infant mortality rates were high globally. In addition, the 1950s was not the first time the government – whether it be the Qing empire, the GMD, or the CCP – attempted to modernize midwifery to address these issues. <br><br> <b>Yet, Ms. Liang’s story</b> sits on the cusp of significant historical change. Throughout the next three decades, the (ex)changes of medical knowledge that were brewing in the first half of the twentieth century became part of public health policies under governments with the resources to standardize and disseminate medical care in China and Taiwan.<p>

          <h6 class="text-uppercase fw-bold" style="padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:0px; padding-left:20px;font-family: Georgia">The Importance of Newspapers</h6>
              <p style="padding-left:10px; font-family: Georgia"><b>This mapping project</b> explores newspaper articles from the People’s Daily and other newspapers in China during the 1950s. These articles offer an interesting perspective on what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) wanted to communicate to the people in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). I am also focusing on the early years of the PRC, to understand early priorities of the government and the Ministry of Health. As I will detail in this chapter, newspaper news article provided both practical advice for safer birthing practices and tried to convince the reader of its effectiveness through local surveys.<br><br><b>For decades</b> before the establishment of the PRC, there were efforts to standardize midwifery to improve infant and maternal health. The changes in the 1950s, then, are not significant because they are the first attempts at standardizing midwifery. Rather, they are important because the 1950s is the first time since the dismantling of the Qing empire that the state was large enough and sufficiently stable to attempt large-scale public health initiatives.<br><br> <b>In Ms. Liang’s case,</b> she was told to go to the hospital for help with her birth, something that was inaccessible to most women in China during the 1950s but improving access to medicine was an important part of the CCP’s policies, and soon a new medical system, closely tied to the government would emerge throughout China. This transformation of midwife care was part of the medical system, and it would eventually make way for the family planning policies of the 1970s. I examine articles from Renmin Ribao to understand how people might have learned about safer birthing practices, how midwives were trained, and the dialogue of medicine itself during the 1950s. These news articles show how midwifery itself was changed, but also how birth work and safety were popularly conveyed. <br>
